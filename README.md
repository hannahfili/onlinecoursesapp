Online courses web app
The system is used to support the management of a training company which main service is running various classes,
depending on the number of people eager to roll in the courses. The appliaction consists of three panels: an administrator, a teacher and a student one.

Admin panel
The administrator has an access to all of the components of the application. The one is eligible to browse the app, to add new courses and fill it with learning materials,
to delete and edit all of the existing courses. When a new user creates their account, the default role assigned to them is the student role.
The admin's duty is to assign the teacher role to the user if it is needed. Also, the admin is able to look through all of the bank transfers made on the platform.
They are also authorised to set the teachers' shifts and to cancel them.

Teacher's and student's role represent admin's role with some restrictions, necessary to guarantee correct app's behaviour.
The student can sign in to courses, make an appointment with the teacher and download the materials.
The teacher sets up their shifts timetable, creates courses and add materials to them. 

The application was being created about 3 months, it strongly requires refactoring. However, it is functional.

Directus projects become deactivated after 3 days, when no requests are sended, so it can bring some troubleshoot when trying to run the application.
